# ZotUI
 
# Deploy the API

To deploy the API, the first step is to **install ZOT** and make sure that it runs perfectly by trying this command in the terminal: **“sbcl --disable-debugger –load /usr/local/zot/bin/start.lisp”**.

**To install Zot, please refer to the Zot documentation linked the bibliography below.**

After Zot is ready and running, the machine should have Python installed. More specifically, the Python version where Zot was developed using **Python 3.9.2** but anything greater than Python 3.7 should be working fine. The Python dependencies to be installed are:**
•	Requests, install by running “pip install requests” in the terminal.
•	Flask, install by running “pip install Flask” in the terminal.
•	CORS for Flask, install by running “pip install Flask-Cors”**
**To start the API just run the script “ZotAPI.py”.**
